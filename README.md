# Manus AI Development Guidance: Best Practices for Building CxQ Plugins

Welcome to the central design guidance for all Manus AI chat sessions at CxQ. This repository contains a unified set of best practices for developing high-quality, consistent, and maintainable software.

By adhering to this guidance, we can streamline our development process, improve collaboration, and ensure that all our projects meet the same high standards.

## Core Principles

Our development philosophy is built on these core principles:

*   **Clarity:** Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand.
*   **Consistency:** Following shared conventions makes our codebase predictable and easy to navigate.
*   **Reusability:** Don't reinvent the wheel. Build and use shared components whenever possible.
*   **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy to debug, update, and extend.

## Guidance Documents

The following documents provide detailed instructions on specific aspects of our development process. Please familiarize yourself with each of them before starting a new project.

*   **[Overall Design Strategy](./DESIGN_STRATEGY.md):** High-level architectural principles, including our commitment to Object-Oriented Programming and code reuse.
*   **[Naming Conventions](./NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md):** Rules for naming plugins, prefixes, variables, functions, and other code elements across different languages.
*   **[Output Structure for WordPress Plugins](./WORDPRESS_OUTPUT_STRUCTURE.md):** Guidelines for packaging WordPress plugins for easy installation and distribution.
*   **[Revisioning (Versioning)](./REVISIONING.md):** Our approach to software versioning using Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
*   **[Available Libraries](./AVAILABLE_LIBRARIES.md):** A catalog of shared, reusable libraries available for use across all CxQ plugins.
