# Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions are a cornerstone of clean, readable, and maintainable code. They improve collaboration by ensuring that all developers can easily understand the purpose of different elements within the codebase. All code, regardless of language, should be written in English.

### 1.1. Global Naming Rules (CxQ Identifiers)

These rules apply to all projects to ensure a unique and conflict-free namespace.

*   **Plugin Names:** All plugin names must start with the prefix `CxQ`.
    *   *Example:* `CxQ Awesome Plugin`

*   **Global Prefixes:** All globally-scoped elements like functions, classes, constants, and database table names must use a unique and recognizable prefix. This prefix must start with `CxQ_` followed by a short, unique identifier for the plugin.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   `CxQ_Auditor_` for the Auditor plugin.
        *   `CxQ_DocBuilder_` for the Document Builder plugin.
